# ComVis17
Repo Containing code for Computer Vision class. 

This repository contains the code I wrote for various labs in the Computer Vision course taught by Dr. Adam Hoover.
If you're taking this course, it's **NOt** a good idea to copy/paste this code and present it. This code however is free to 
be read, modified and improved. 

Note: Almost all the code in this repository works with 8 bit grayscale images in the PPM format.If you want your own format 
to work, you need to write some additional read/write code yourself.
